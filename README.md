## Background
######  Economic growth is currently growing very rapidly when the global market begins to become global. This cannot be separated from the role of increasing sophisticated and intelligent technology to help human work. One form of economic growth that is assimilated to the role of technology is E-commerce. In the current era, we can see firsthand how the economic growth in the field of E-Commerce is growing very fast. On the other hand, the fashion industry is also growing very rapidly and the right technology is needed to maintain the consistency of the development of this fashion industry.
######  E-Commerce is generally a place for buying and selling goods digitally. Each E-Commerce has its own advantages and disadvantages. In Indonesia, the most popular E-Commerce are Shopee, Lazada, Tokopedia, Bukalapak, Blibli, and others. Meanwhile, only Zalora is an E-Commerce which specializes in fashion. This is where we try to develop E-Commerce which is engaged in fashion. But not only that, we also want to add Artificial Intelligence technology as an added value to the development of our technology products
######  This study presents a recommendation system that is implemented in an e-commerce based on images uploaded by users. The recommendations that can be displayed in our app are based on gender, subCategory, masterCategory, articleType and basecolour. Based on this, customer preferences in choosing products can change according to customer needs. This will certainly increase the purchase of fashion retail products which will later be profitable for e-commerce and the advantage for customers is the ease of finding the fashion that suits them. 

## Reason for choosing the theme capstone 
###### We chose the theme of Tourism, Creative, and digital economy because of the problems that arise in an e-commerce retail fashion application, namely:
- item 1 The difficulty of fashion retail e-commerce in providing recommendations based on categories and types of clothing for customers.
- item 2 Customers often experience confusion in determining the clothes they want to buy at an e-commerce retail fashion.
###### Based on the existing problems, we tried to overcome this by creating a fashion recommender feature based on the similarity of the image uploaded by the user.
